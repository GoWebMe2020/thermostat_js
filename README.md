Build a thermostat with JavaScript tht can be changed in the browser.

### User Stories

- [x] Thermostat starts at 20 degrees
- [x] You can increase the temp with an up function
- [x] You can decrease the temp with a down function
- [ ] The minimum temperature is 10 degrees
- [ ] If power saving mode is on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees
- [ ] If power saving mode is off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees
- [ ] Power saving mode is on by default
- [ ] You can reset the temperature to 20 with a reset function
- [ ] You can ask about the thermostat's current energy usage: < 18 is low-usage, <= 25 is medium-usage, anything else is high-usage.
- [ ] (In the challenges where we add an interface, low-usage will be indicated with green, medium-usage indicated with black, high-usage indicated with red.)

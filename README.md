4. The minimum temperature is 10 degrees[x]
5. If power saving mode is on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees[ ]
6. If power saving mode is off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees[ ]
7. Power saving mode is on by default[ ]
8. You can reset the temperature to 20 with a reset function[ ]
9. You can ask about the thermostat's current energy usage: < 18 is low-usage, <= 25 is medium-usage, anything else is high-usage.[ ]
10. (In the challenges where we add an interface, low-usage will be indicated with green, medium-usage indicated with black, high-usage indicated with red.)[ ]
